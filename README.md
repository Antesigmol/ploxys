# ploxys
Simple genetic algorithm based in biological simulation of a population of primitive cells.

Version 1.1

1- How to use it: 
Simply answer the questions and select a name for the data storage directory. (The time unit is 1 round) 

Suggested conditions: 
initial amount of ploxys: 200
initial amount of food: 2000
number of rounds: 1000
minimal initial lifespan: 200 or 300
maximal initial lifespan: 300 or 400
data directory's name: test

2- How does it works?
It uses a population of creatures called ploxys and simulates their lives. Each ploxy consists of a python list holding its xy position, lifespan, birthdate, generation and how many children it will give birth. Each time a ploxy eats a piece of food it will reproduce and its children will have similar characteristics, but with random small mutations. After some rounds, the best ploxys will overtake the population.

3- Why use it? 
This example is good for education, learning python (although its pretty messy) and have a brief introduction on genetic algorithm (most genetic algorithms work with parenting reproduction, but this one is about primitive cells and asexual reproduction)

4- Why i made it? 
Because i love python and had nothing to do with my free time.

Right now i am running some simulations and collecting a lot of data to make some reports and have fun with the results.

Thank you for your time.
